Anonymization Techniques and Applications

Technique	Description	Suitable Data Types	Use Cases
Data Masking	Replaces sensitive data with altered values while maintaining data format.	Structured data	Protecting PII in databases
Pseudonymization	Substitutes identifiers with pseudonyms to conceal identities.	Structured and unstructured	De-identifying user data
Generalization	Reduces data precision to prevent identification.	Numerical and categorical	Aggregating data for statistical analysis
Perturbation	Adds noise to data to obscure original values.	Numerical data	Sharing datasets for research
Data Shuffling	Rearranges data entries to break the link between data and individuals.	Structured data	Anonymizing survey responses
Synthetic Data	Generates artificial data that retains statistical properties of original data.	Any data type	Testing and development without real data
